# CIS1051-Final-Project

My experience during this final project had a lot of ups and downs. I initially wanted to completely make a function Blackjack game with
a bribery function. Unfortunately that was a lot harder task than anticipated. One of the biggest issues I ran into was trying to create
a class for all the cards. I wanted to make an interactive game with drawable cards. I did make it interactive and visually pleasing but
I could not figure out how to load the images for the cards when the cards were in a class. I tried three times and I could not figure
out how to load seperate images in a class. So instead I loaded all the cards in the beginning of the game and just called them in functions.
This allowed me to assign values to each card and use those values when the cards were drawn. Another struggle was assigning a key to do
multiple actions when pressed multiple times. I tried implementing it with a table but I could not understand the syntax of the table to
properly implement it. Instead I created a variable that counted +1 when the key was pressed. If the key was pressed it would +1 and then 
call a function with if statements. This was the best I could come up. Overall, the project was very fun and challenging. I would sit down
and try implement a new thing into my game but would keep deleting the code because it would not work. It was a great learning experience
and I cannot wait to work on my own personal projects during the winterbreak.

Thank you Professor Rossen and Tamara Katic for an awesome semester!
