# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Blackjak (Blackjack but with my initials, JAK.)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will create a Blackjack game where it's just the player and the house competing to win a pot of money. I will add a twist where you can tip the dealer to improve your chances of winning.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will recreate the game of Blackjack where it will be a 1v1 against the player and the house. The premise of the game is, the player will draw two cards face up and the dealer will draw two cards as well, one face up and the other one face down. The goal of the game is to try and got a total of 21 points with your cards. Card values will follow (Numbers 1-9 hold their own value, Face cards hold 10 points and aces can either be 1 or 11 points). If the player draws more than 21 points, they have lost that hand and their money they bet on that hand goes to the house. If the player draws less than a 21 and stays, the dealer's turn commences. The dealer will hit until their cards are 17 or higher. If the dealer draws over 21 or does not draw closer to 21 than the player, the player wins. If the player wins, the player's money is doubled. If the player loses, the player's bet goes to the house. One of the features will include a bribery aspect, if the player tips the dealer, the dealer may or may not assist in the next hand in the player's favor. This will be executed with LOVE/Lua and I will implement a table with cards appearing on the screen. I will also try implementing options during and after turns for the player to make decisions.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will implement the basic visual of Blackjack as well as a basic function of the point system. I will also make sure to add a balance for the player, to increase/decrease. Once the balance is zero, the player cannot gamble any longer and will get kicked off the table.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In a better outcome, I will incoporate the complete visual aspect of turned over cards and face value cards. I will also try implementing choices such as buttons for the player to decide on whether they want to hit or stay on a particular turn. I hope to implement doubling and splitting. Doubling is when a player can double their bet and draw another card. A split is when you have two of the same card and can double each of those cards to try and win.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my final project would be the complete implementation of Blackjack and a bribery system where it may help or harm you depending on how to dealer is feeling towards the player. I hope to implement a system where sometimes the player will get a good hand and sometimes the player will get kicked out for cheating.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step to continue learning Lua ad LOVE. I will need to acquire skills to implement the card images and make sure to implement a random drawing system that places the cards accordingly to each hand drawn for both the player and the dealer. I will also need to research how to make a game interactive with Lua by clicking text options or buttons.
