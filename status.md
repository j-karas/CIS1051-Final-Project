Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have implemented a start screen, a rules page, and the game page. In the game page, I have finished the test card but I need to implement the finished cards for the dealer and the player.
I also implemented betting for the player.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to finish the base game, the player's hand and the dealer's hand. I also need to implement the drawing a card function, doubling function(right now, I'm struggling to see how to implement these).

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I've encountered problems with making the cards into a class. Right now, I am unable to make them into a functioning class. I have also had problems with implementing a function to draw cards and create new cards when the player plays a new hand.
Right now I am only able to implement the cards if they're already existing. I tried making the cards into a class but I couldn't complete it successfully. I also tried making a function to randomize the value of a card but right now I have to write
all the card if statements individually respective to each card. This problem relates back to the problem where I couldn't create individual card classes. The reason I think I have so much problems with classes and the cards is because each card is
associated with their respective card image. I couldn't assign an image to each card with the class.
